# Build System
This project implements a minimal build system in python that uses Python to parse '.html.template' files and insert html componenets to avoid code duplication.
At the moment this is primarily used to ensure all pages are using the exact same navigation bar.

To build that static pages locally just run:
> 'python3 build_system/builder.py'
